## Training ##

The EMPOWER model is trained in two levels. It is dual-tier deep prompt tuning approach. In the first level, it encapsulates the relevant knowledge into continuous knowledge-attributed deep prompts and in second level, it utilizes the encoded knowledge for knowledge-aware response generation.


**Stage 1: "KDPT: Knowledge-attributed Deep Prompt Tuning"**
For the first level training, run kdpt.sh script file.


**Stage 2: "RDPT: Response-attributed Deep Prompt Tuning"**
For RDPT tarining, run rdpt.sh script file.

## Inference ##
Once the training is finished, run the gen.sh script file to conduct the inference stage.
